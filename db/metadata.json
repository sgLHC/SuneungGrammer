        "문제": "Hello, everyone! Welcome back to your favorite online channel, With Ethan. As always, I’m trying to make this channel a place that my followers of all ages can enjoy. Recently, in the comments section, there have been some examples of language that is inappropriate for younger viewers. Also, there have been some comments that are not relevant to this channel. These kinds of comments are unacceptable for a channel like this. I would really like to ask that all of my followers keep these things in mind so that we can all enjoy this channel. I always appreciate your time and support. Please keep watching.",
